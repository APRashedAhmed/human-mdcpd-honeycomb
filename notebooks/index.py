"""Index script that returns `Path` objects to *git tracked* locations the repo

Uses the tracked files by git to determine what is worth referencing or not, and
then add them to the globals dict so they are importable. Starts with the list
of tracked files not in the importable module, then looks for all directories
`_dir_levels` deep from the main repo. In this setup, setting `_dir_levels` to
`0` would return just the top level directories.
