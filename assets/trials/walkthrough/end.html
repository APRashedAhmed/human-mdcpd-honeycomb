      Now that you have completed the walkthrough, we have a few practice videos
      which are identical to the main task. Please note that unlike the walkthrough
      videos, the the videos will not be controllable, the speed of the ball is
      increased, the videos are much shorter, and you will have 10 seconds to respond
      before it counts as a missed trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please answer as accurately as possible. For these practice videos, you will
      be given feedback on your color choice after each choice.
