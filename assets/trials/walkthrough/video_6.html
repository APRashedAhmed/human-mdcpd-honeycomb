      Most videos will end with the ball behind the gray filter and you will need
      to select what you think the <b>final color</b>  and how <b>confident</b>
      you are in your selection, even if you cannot directly see the color.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this video, the ball enters the gray filter as the color
      <span style='color: green;'><b>green</b></span> and does not change color
      while behind the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the video ends, click <b>next</b> to view the color choice and confidence
      screens. Please select which you think is the <b>final color</b> and how
      <b>confident</b> you are.
