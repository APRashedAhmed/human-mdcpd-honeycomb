      Now that you have completed the walkthrough, we have a few practice videos
      which are identical to the main task. Please note that unlike the walkthrough
      videos, the the videos will not be controllable, the speed of the ball is
      increased, and the videos are much shorter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please answer as accurately and quickly as possible. For these practice
      videos, you will be given feedback on your color choice after each choice.
