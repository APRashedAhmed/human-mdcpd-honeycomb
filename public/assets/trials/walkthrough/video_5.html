    <!-- "video_4": "The real task will have a grayzone like in this video, which conceals the color of the ball as it passes by. Note that the color of the ball can still change even if it is not viewable. In video ends with the color of the ball being visibly <span style='color: red;'><b>red</b></span>, however for most trials the ball will not be viewable at the end. <br>Once the video ends, click next to be shown the choice screen.", -->
    <p>
      The real task will have a gray filter in the middle of the screen which
      allows you to see the position of the ball but <b>hides the color</b> when
      it passes through. Importantly, <b>the ball can change color</b> when passing
      through the gray filter. In this video, the ball ends as
      <span style='color: red;'><b>red</b></span> in the visible region, but for
      most videos the ball will end behind the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the video ends, click <b>next</b> to view the color choice and confidence
      screens, and please select <span style="color: red"><b>red</b></span> and
      <b>high confidence</b>.
