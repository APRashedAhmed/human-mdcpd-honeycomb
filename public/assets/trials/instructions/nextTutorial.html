      To help understand the task, we prepared a short walkthrough to demonstrate
      the core elements of each video.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will be able to pause and rewind the videos as you please during the walkthrough,
      but note that the videos in the main task cannot be interacted with and will
      only play once before transitioning to the color choice screen. Additionally,
      we have reduced the speed of the ball in the walkthrough videos to further
      help with understanding the task.
