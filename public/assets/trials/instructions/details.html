        In this experiment you will watch videos of a ball bouncing around the screen that changes
        colors between
        <span style="color: red"><b>red</b></span
        >, <span style="color: green"><b>green</b></span
        >, and <span style="color: blue"><b>blue</b></span
        >. At the end of each video, a new screen will be shown where you will be asked to report
        the <b>final color</b> of the ball by clicking on the buttons for
        <span style="color: red"><b>red</b></span
        >, <span style="color: green"><b>green</b></span
        >, or
        <span style="color: blue"><b>blue</b></span>
        . You will then be asked to enter how confident you were in your response with a slider
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly after you adjust the confidence slider, the next video will begin, repeating the
        process.
        <i
          >It's expected that you enter a choice and indicate your confidence to the best of your
          ability on each video.</i
        >
        Videos and their corresponding choice-screens will be presented as quickly as possible to
        minimize the time it takes to complete the full experiment.
