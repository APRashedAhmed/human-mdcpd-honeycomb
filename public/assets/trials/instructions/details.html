        In this experiment you will watch videos of a ball bouncing around the
	screen that changes colors between
	<span style="color: red"><b>red</b></span>,
	<span style="color: green"><b>green</b></span>,
	and <span style="color: blue"><b>blue</b></span>.
      </p>
      <p>	
	At the end of each video, a new screen will be shown where you will be
	asked to guess the <b>final color</b> of the ball and <b>how confident</b>
	you are in your response. Shortly after, the next video will begin,
	repeating the process.
      </p>
      <p>
      <br>
	When we calculate the final score for the task, the <b>confidence</b> you select
	on a trial behaves like a <b>wager</b>, where a higher confidence on a
	correct guess <b>gives you more points</b>, but also <b>takes away more points if
	you are incorrect</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
      <br>
	You will have <b>5 seconds</b> to input a color and confidence, and will
      lose points if you do not provide an input in time.
