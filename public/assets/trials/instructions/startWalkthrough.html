      For the purposes of understanding the task, we prepared a short walkthrough
      meant to demonstrate the core elements of the task. <br><br>You will be
      able to pause and rewind the videos as you please during the walkthrough,
      but note that the videos in the main task cannot be interacted with and will
      only play once before transitioning to the color choice screen. Additionally,
      we have reduced the speed of the ball in the walkthrough videos to further
      help with understanding the task. <br><br>Press next to begin the walkthrough.
