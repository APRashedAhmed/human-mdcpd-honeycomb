    <h3 id="purpose-of-the-research"><b>Purpose of the Research</b></h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate how people understand multiple
      visual features that dynamically change by assessing their performance on
      a online task.

    <h3 id="behavioral-procedures"><b>Behavioral Procedures</b></h3>
    <p>
      The task involves watching videos of a ball bouncing around the screen as it
      changes color and pressing on the keyboard to indicate the final color of the
      ball. You will be shown and respond to series of videos organized into blocks,
      between which you will receive feedback on your performance during that block.
    </p>

    <h3 id="time-required"><b>Time Required</b></h3>
    <p>
      The main task will require approximately one hour to complete.
    </p>

    <h3 id="compensation"><b>Compensation</b></h3>
    <p>
      You will receive TOTAL_COMPENSATION for your time in addition to being compensated
      according to your performance on the task in terms of accuracy and response
      time.
    </p>

    <h3 id="risks"><b>Risks</b></h3>
    <p>
      You might get tired while doing the task or have some discomfort from sitting
      still and minimizing your movement. The task will include breaks between each
      block at which time you will have the opportunity to stretch and move as necessary.

    <p>
      Your records will be confidential. You will not be identified in any reports or publications resulting from the
      study. It is possible that representatives of the sponsor that supports the research study will want to come to 
      Brown University to review your information. Representatives of regulatory agencies (including the Brown
      University Human Research Protection Program) may access your records. You may be asked for your 
      Amazon.com Mechanical Turk or Prolific.com username and email address for the purpose of 
      compensation through Mechanical Turk or Prolific member services, however, research personnel will not 
      have access to your bank information at any time.

    <p>
      All experiments conducted online are hosted on a Brown 
      University secure server. Your data, including responses to questionnaires, will be maintained on a 
      password-protected database on that server. Your email address will be maintained in a location that is 
      separate from the rest of your information. To preserve confidentiality, you will be assigned a number and 
      you will automatically be identified on all forms by number only such that your name and data collected 
      about you are not linked in any way. Furthermore, any data stored on a computer will reference you only by
      this number. Only investigators delegated to this study will have access to this data and none of this data 
      will be shared with third parties.
