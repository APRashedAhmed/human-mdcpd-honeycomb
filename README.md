To install all necessary dependencies and prerequisites for the task, follow the instructions here until the end of the page:

To get started running a local development server, you'll need to run these few commands (note that you'll need two separate terminal windows open):

cd src (assuming you're in the root directory)
node server.js

(assuming you're in root directory)
npm run dev

This should start a live development server where you can freely make updates/changes which are reflected immediately

_Note: previously named Neuro Task Starter, some references may still refer to it as such._
